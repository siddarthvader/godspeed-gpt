In many data models, data of an entity in your graph may depend on the data of other related entities. For ex. if a married woman has a new child, the husband also has a new child. And vice versa.\nGodspeed gives you an easy way to manage complex data dependencies between related entities of your information graph. As any update is made to any Entity in your Graph, Godspeed checks if any part of the remaining Graph should be updated by this change as per your data model settings. If yes, it updates the entire affected Graph (Butterfly effect). This saves LOTS of lines of code, time and effort in maintaining your inter-dependent data state so that you can move faster with your development goals. For now Godspeed supports two kinds of dependencies - Union from and Copy.  Union from   Settings are in configFolder/schema/union.toml Union from operation can be used to compute and store distinct values, whether relationships or data values, merged from field values of multiple related entities.This is useful for one to many or many to many relationships. Please look at the following examples to understand.   CODE ```   [conference]    speakers = '+talks.speaker' #As soon as a talk is linked to a conferece, or an already linked talk gets linked to a speaker, *the talk’s speaker is also linked to the conference as one of its speakers, if not already linked before*. Vice versa happens if the talk is unlinked to its speaker, or the talk is removed from the conference    topics = '+talks.topics' #As soon as a talk is linked to an conference, or a topic is set to an already linked talk, the talk’s topic is also added to the conference as one of its topics, if not already there. Vice versa happens if the talk is unliked to the conference, or the topic is removed from the talk.

In many data models, data of an entity in your graph may depend on the data of other related entities. For ex. if a married woman has a new child, the husband also has a new child. And vice versa.\nGodspeed gives you an easy way to manage complex data dependencies between related entities of your information graph. As any update is made to any Entity in your Graph, Godspeed checks if any part of the remaining Graph should be updated by this change as per your data model settings. If yes, it updates the entire affected Graph (Butterfly effect) This saves LOTS of lines of code, time and effort in maintaining your inter-dependent data state so that you can move faster with your development goals. For now Godspeed supports two kinds of dependencies - Union from and Copy.  Union from   Settings are in configFolder/schema/union.toml Union from operation can be used to compute and store distinct values, whether relationships or data values, merged from field values of multiple related entities.This is useful for one to many or many to many relationships. Please look at the following examples to understand.   CODE ```   [conference]    speakers = '+talks.speaker' #As soon as a talk is linked to a conferece, or an already linked talk gets linked to a speaker, *the talk’s speaker is also linked to the conference as one of its speakers, if not already linked before* Vice versa happens if the talk is unlinked to its speaker, or the talk is removed from the conference    topics = '+talks.topics' #As soon as a talk is linked to an conference, or a topic is set to an already linked talk, the talk’s topic is also added to the conference as one of its topics, if not already there.

The developer only needs to specify the schema of third party API, own microservice API, and datastore model. Rest is taken care of by the framework. In case of more complex validation scenarios, where customer journeys may require conditional validation of incoming requests based on some attributes (in the database or the query {i.e. subject, object, environment, payload}), the developer can add such rules to the application logic as part of the workflows.

We want the developers to be able to speedily develop microservices in days, instead of months.For the same, we are trying to provide everything that a team needs to create and operate modern microservices. It will be configuration/templating driven, plug & play, extensible by nature and cloud independent. There will be no vendor lock-in, either with Godspeed or any vendor used. It will give developers choice and control over the kind of tools, DBs and cloud providers they wish to use, while following standards and unified interfaces.This framework is being systematically developed by Mindgrep over the last years, across various projects by extracting abstractions and reusable components.

The value for the custom identifier will be picked up from event body, params, query, or headers.   To enable this feature ,you need to specify two things:     CODE ``` log_attributes ``` CODE  variable as  LINK-> environment variable /docs/microservices/setup/configuration/env-vars <-LINK / LINK-> static variable /docs/microservices/setup/configuration/static-vars <-LINK  which contains custom identifiers. For example, this is the sample static configuration:   CODE ```   log_attributes:       mobileNumber: \"query?.mobileNumber\"      id: \"params?.id\"      lan: \"body?.data?.lan\"   ``` CODE              location of the identifier in the request payload. As specified in the above example,   if mobileNumber is present in query params then specify  CODE ``` query?.mobileNumber ``` CODE .  if id is present in path params then specify  CODE ``` params?.id ``` CODE .  if lan is present in data field inside body then specify  CODE ``` body?.data?.lan ``` CODE .        note   Please make sure to add ? in case any field is optional like  CODE ``` body?.data?.lan ``` CODE  so that it works well with undefined values. This will add lan in the logs if it is present else it will not get added.

identifier in the logging whenever any event is triggered on your service. The value for the custom identifier will be picked up from event body, params, query, or headers.   To enable this feature ,you need to specify two things:     CODE ``` log_attributes ``` CODE  variable as  LINK-> environment variable /docs/microservices/setup/configuration/env-vars <-LINK / LINK-> static variable /docs/microservices/setup/configuration/static-vars <-LINK  which contains custom identifiers.

As specified in the above example,   if mobileNumber is present in query params then specify  CODE ``` query?.mobileNumber ``` CODE   if id is present in path params then specify  CODE ``` params?.id ``` CODE   if lan is present in data field inside body then specify  CODE ``` body?.data?.lan ``` CODE         note   Please make sure to add ? in case any field is optional like  CODE ``` body?.data?.lan ``` CODE  so that it works well with undefined values.
